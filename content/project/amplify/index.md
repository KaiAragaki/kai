# Overview

`amplify` is a toolbelt for people who perform and analyze qPCR. It can help you:

- Plan your pcr experiment, from sample dilution to plate layout
- Read in untidy pcr data, tidily
- Manipulate your data, such as outlier detection, re-RQing your data, slope recalculation, etc
- Visualize your data or your plate

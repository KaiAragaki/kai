bio: I am a PhD candidate at the Greenberg Bladder Cancer Institute at Johns Hopkins. I am interested in uncovering the mechanism by which indolent bladder cancer becomes invasive. To this end, I work both 'wet' and 'dry', leveraging and generating large datasets for hypothesis generation *in silico*, and performing mechanistic studies *in vitro* and  *in vivo*.

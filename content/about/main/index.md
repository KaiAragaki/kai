  I'm a Pharmacology PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University. I work in the Greenberg Bladder Cancer Institute, where my work spans from fully dry lab work (computational analysis in R) to fully wet lab work (_in vitro_ 2D/3D cell culture, western blotting, PCR, etc.) to somewhere between (eg RNAseq analysis from samples I've generated). I also drink a lot of coffee.

  In my down time, [I enjoy making tools for people](/project/) (and myself).

  If you have any questions, feel free to [contact](/contact/) me or message me on social media!
